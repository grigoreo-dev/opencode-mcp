# Architecture

## Overview

opencode-mcp is an MCP server that bridges MCP clients to the OpenCode headless HTTP API. It speaks **stdio** by default, and can optionally serve the same MCP over **Streamable HTTP**.

```
                  stdio (default)
┌─────────────┐  ──────────────────▶  ┌───────────────┐     HTTP      ┌─────────────────────────┐
│  MCP Client  │       JSON-RPC        │  opencode-mcp  │ <──────────> │  OpenCode Server        │
│  (Claude,    │                       │  (this package) │   REST API   │  (in-process via SDK,   │
│   Cursor)    │  ──────────────────▶  │                 │              │   or external `opencode │
│              │   Streamable HTTP      │                 │              │   serve` you launched)  │
└─────────────┘   (POST /mcp, opt-in)  └───────────────┘              └─────────────────────────┘
```

The client-facing transport is selected by `OPENCODE_MCP_TRANSPORT`: **stdio** is the default; setting it to `http` starts a Streamable HTTP endpoint (backed by the SDK's `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`) at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`, guarded by a bearer token (`OPENCODE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, required unless `OPENCODE_MCP_HTTP_INSECURE=true`). This choice is **orthogonal** to how this server reaches the upstream OpenCode API — the outbound HTTP/REST leg to the OpenCode Server (in-process via the SDK or an external `opencode serve`) is identical for both transports.

## Three MCP Primitives

| Primitive | Count | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | 80 | Actions the LLM can take |
| **Resources** | 10 | Data the LLM can browse |
| **Prompts** | 6 | Guided multi-step workflows |

## Key Design Decisions

### Layered Tool Architecture

Tools are in two layers:

- **Low-level** — 1:1 mapping to OpenCode API endpoints (session, message, file, etc.)
- **Workflow** — Composite operations that combine multiple calls (`opencode_ask`, `opencode_run`, `opencode_fire`, etc.)

The workflow layer drastically reduces tool calls. Instead of "create session, send message, parse response", it's one `opencode_ask` call. For long-running tasks, `opencode_run` handles session creation + async dispatch + polling in one call. `opencode_fire` + `opencode_check` enables background work with lightweight monitoring.

### Tool Annotations

Every tool carries MCP annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`) so clients can make informed decisions about safety. Read-only tools like `opencode_check` and `opencode_context` are annotated as safe; destructive tools like `opencode_instance_dispose` are flagged.

### Smart Response Formatting

Raw API responses are deeply nested JSON. The `helpers.ts` module transforms these into human-readable text:

- Message parts -> extracted text, tool call summaries
- Diffs -> formatted with file paths, add/delete counts
- Session lists -> bullet-point format with titles and IDs
- Large responses -> auto-truncated at 50K characters

### Robust HTTP Client

`OpenCodeClient` handles:

- **Automatic retry** — Exponential backoff for 429, 502, 503, 504
- **Error categorization** — `OpenCodeError` with `.isTransient`, `.isNotFound`, `.isAuth`
- **204 No Content** — Properly handled
- **SSE streaming** — Async generator for Server-Sent Events
- **Directory validation** — Paths are normalized (resolved to absolute, trailing slashes removed) and validated (must exist on disk) before being sent as the `x-opencode-directory` header
- **Lazy reconnection** — If all retries fail due to connection errors (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOTFOUND`, etc.) and `autoServe` is enabled, the client attempts to restart the OpenCode server and retry once (up to 3 reconnection attempts per MCP session)

### Default Provider/Model

Tools that accept `providerID` and `modelID` apply a three-tier resolution:

1. **Explicit params** — If both are passed to the tool call, use them
2. **Env-var defaults** — If `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` and `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_MODEL` are set, use them as fallback
3. **Server default** — If neither is available, let the OpenCode server decide (may result in empty responses if no provider is configured)

This is implemented via `applyModelDefaults()` in `helpers.ts`, called from all 8 tools that accept model params.

### Auto-Start

On startup, the MCP probes `OPENCODE_BASE_URL/global/health`. If a server is already running there (e.g. an externally-launched `opencode serve` or another MCP instance), it attaches. Otherwise it spawns one **in-process** via `createOpencodeServer()` from `@opencode-ai/sdk` — the HTTP server binds to the requested host/port from inside the MCP process itself, with no child-process or binary-discovery step. Shutdown handlers (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, `exit`) call the SDK's `close()` so the port is released cleanly when the MCP exits.

Concurrent `ensureServer()` calls are coalesced per `baseUrl` via an in-flight `Map<string, Promise>` so two simultaneous tool calls during cold-start can't race into `EADDRINUSE`. Calls targeting different baseUrls each get their own startup promise.

## Data Flow

### Tool Call

```
1. MCP Client sends JSON-RPC tool call via stdio
2. McpServer dispatches to registered handler
3. Handler builds HTTP request
4. OpenCodeClient makes HTTP call to OpenCode
5. Response formatted by helpers.ts
6. Formatted text returned as MCP tool result
7. McpServer sends JSON-RPC response via stdio
```

### Resource Read

```
1. Client requests resource by URI (e.g. opencode://health)
2. Handler fetches from OpenCode via HTTP
3. Data returned as resource content (JSON)
```

### SSE Events

```
1. opencode_events_poll opens SSE connection to /event
2. Events collected for specified duration
3. Connection closed, events formatted and returned
```

## Registration Pattern

Each tool group is a file exporting a `register*` function that receives `(server, client)`. New tool groups can be added without touching the entry point.

### Permission Handling

In headless mode, OpenCode may pause sessions waiting for tool-use permissions (e.g. file writes, shell commands). This blocks progress silently. The MCP server addresses this with:

- **`opencode_permission_list`** — Lists all pending permission requests across sessions so the LLM can detect and unblock stuck sessions
- **`opencode_session_permission`** — Replies to a specific permission request with `once`, `always`, or `reject`
- **Recommended config** — Set `"permission": "allow"` in `opencode.json` or call `opencode_config_update({ config: { permission: "allow" } })` at runtime to auto-approve all tool use in headless mode
